# CZ3003 : Software System Analysis and Design

## Learning Outcome
I have learnt **software system integration**. The coursework includes a group project where our group represents 911 Team as part of the National Emergency Crisis Management System. I have contributed my work to the 911 Team by building a web GUI for 911 operator. The project has enabled me to understand how to design and implement farily decent websites using ``HTML``, ``CSS`` and ``Javascript``. 

## Coursework Group Project

- The entire laboratory group is responsible for an ``national emergency
crisis management system`` involving four subsystems, namely 911, Crisis Management Office,
Prime Minister Office and Emergency Force. 
- Our team members belong to ``911 subsystem`` and implemented ``two web GUIs`` for 911 operator and supervisor respectively and set up 
``local storage of data`` that are associated with incident reports. 
- We communicated with CMO team via API calls by providing required data in case of simulated crisis.

Refer to the assignment report and documents attached for more details.
